\title{Perform Cross Validation}
\usage{
cross_validation(
  gram,
  lambda,
  folds_number = nrow(gram),
  estimator_type = "standard"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gram}{A square symmetric matrix representing the Gram matrix of the data.}

\item{folds_number}{The number of folds to divide the data into for cross-validation. Defaults to the number of rows in 'gram'.}

\item{betas}{A numeric vector of coefficients to be applied during calculation.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the average cross-validation error.
}
\description{
This function performs cross-validation over a specified number of folds.
It divides the data into train and test sets, applies the 'process_fold'
function to each, and calculates the average error across all folds. Leave-One-Out
Cross Validation when number of folds is equal to the dimension of gram matrix.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'gram', 'betas', and an appropriate 'folds_number' are defined
# cross_validation(gram, betas, folds_number)
}
