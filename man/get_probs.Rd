\title{Compute Normalized Probabilities for Sampled and Grid Points}
\usage{
get_probs(
  centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled,
  centered_kernel_mat_at_grid,
  centerd_kernel_self_grid,
  x_grid,
  lambda_hat,
  weight_hat_vec
)
}
\arguments{
\item{centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled}{A square matrix (n x n) where n is the number of sampled points.
The matrix should be a centered kernel matrix evaluated at the sampled points.}

\item{centered_kernel_mat_at_grid}{A matrix (n x m) where n is the number of sampled points
and m is the number of grid points. The matrix should be a centered kernel matrix
evaluated at the grid points.}

\item{centerd_kernel_self_grid}{A vector (length m) representing the diagonal of the centered kernel
matrix evaluated at the grid points.}

\item{x_grid}{A vector of grid points where the probabilities are evaluated.}

\item{lambda_hat}{A scalar value representing the estimated lambda.}

\item{weight_hat_vec}{A vector of weights (length n) corresponding to the sampled points.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
        \item{sampled_x}{A vector of normalized probabilities at the sampled points.}
        \item{grid_x}{A vector of normalized probabilities at the grid points.}
}
\description{
This function computes normalized probabilities for both sampled points and grid points.
The normalization is done by dividing the probabilities by the integral over the grid points.

# Example usage (assuming inputs are defined):
probs <- get_probs(centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled, centered_kernel_mat_at_grid,
                   centerd_kernel_self_grid, x_grid, lambda_hat, weight_hat_vec)
