\title{Generate Random Samples from a Mixture of Gaussian Distributions}
\usage{
rnorm_mixture(n, means, sds, probabilities)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer, the number of samples to generate.}

\item{means}{Numeric vector, the means of each Gaussian component in the mixture.}

\item{sds}{Numeric vector, the standard deviations of each Gaussian component in the mixture.}

\item{probabilities}{Numeric vector, the mixing probabilities for each component.
The probabilities must sum to 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of random samples drawn from the specified mixture of Gaussian distributions.
}
\description{
This function generates random samples from a specified mixture of Gaussian distributions.
It allows for the specification of the means, standard deviations, and mixture probabilities
for each component of the mixture.

probabilities = c(0.3, 0.7)
samples = rnorm_mixture(n, means, sds, probabilities)
