\title{Compute Approximate Probabilities and Densities on a Grid}
\usage{
get_grid_approx_dens_or_probs_vectorized(sample, grid, dens_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{A numeric vector of sample points for which the probabilities or densities need to be approximated.}

\item{grid}{A numeric vector representing the grid points on which the densities or probabilities are defined.}

\item{dens_list}{A list containing the grid probabilities or densities.
It must include an element `grid_x`, which is a numeric vector of probabilities or densities corresponding to the grid points.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\describe{
  \item{`prob`}{A numeric vector of approximate probabilities for the sample points, normalized to sum to 1.}
  \item{`dens`}{A numeric vector of approximate densities for the sample points, based on interval lengths.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates approximate probabilities and densities for given sample points
based on a specified grid and a list of densities or probabilities on that grid.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Compute probabilities and densities
sample <- c(1, 3, 5)
grid <- c(0, 2, 4, 6)
dens_list <- list(grid_x = c(0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2))

result <- get_grid_approx_dens_or_probs(sample, grid, dens_list)

# Access the approximate probabilities
print(result$prob)

# Access the approximate densities
print(result$dens)
