\title{Compute Probabilities at Sampled Points}
\usage{
prob_at_sampled_x(centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled, lambda_hat, weight_hat_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled}{A square matrix (n x n) where n is the number of sampled points.
The matrix should be a centered kernel matrix evaluated at the sampled points.}

\item{lambda_hat}{A scalar value representing the estimated lambda.}

\item{weight_hat_vec}{A vector of weights (length n) corresponding to the sampled points.}
}
\value{
A vector of probabilities (length n) corresponding to the sampled points.
}
\description{
This function computes the probabilities at sampled points based on a centered kernel matrix,
estimated lambda, and a weight vector.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (assuming centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled, lambda_hat, and weight_hat_vec are defined):
prob_vec <- prob_at_sampled_x(centered_kernel_mat_at_sampled, lambda_hat, weight_hat_vec)
}
