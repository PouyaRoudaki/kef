\title{Calculate Cross Validation Error for Each Fold}
\usage{
process_fold(gram, fold, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{fold}{A list containing training and testing subsets identified by 'id'.}

\item{betas}{A numeric vector of coefficients to be applied during calculation.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the cross-validation error for the fold.
}
\description{
This function calculates the cross-validation error for a given fold of data
by computing the sum of three summands based on the provided 'betas' and a
precomputed Gram matrix 'gram' indexed by train and test IDs.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'gram' and 'betas' are predefined and a 'fold' structure is available
# process_fold(fold, beta)
}
